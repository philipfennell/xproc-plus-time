Parsing the pipeline
--------------------

* Explicitly bind ports:
	* Add declared ports.
	* Each input that binds to an output must be represented by a p:pipe.

* Identify renderable steps with the css:visibility property.




Representing the pipeline
-------------------------

* Create a representation of a step.

* Connect steps according to the explicit port bindings.

* Animate the 'flow' of documents through the pipeline.
